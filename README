	This is a Unix/C rewrite of the fine BinChunker software for
	some non-Unix system. The non-Unix version of BinChunker
	can be found at http://home.ptd.net/~redline/binchunker.html .
	Thanks go to Bob Marietta <marietrg@SLU.EDU>, the author of
	BinChunker, for the extensive help, documentation and letting me
	look at his Pascal/Delphi source code!

  What on earth is this stuff:
  
  	binchunker converts a CD image in a ".bin / .cue" format
  	(sometimes ".raw / .cue") to a set of .iso and .cdr tracks.
  	
  	The bin/cue format is used by some non-Unix cd-writing
  	software, but is not supported on most other cd-writing
  	programs.
  	
  	The .iso track contains an ISO file system, which can be
  	mounted through a loop device on Linux systems, or
  	written on a CD-R using cdrecord.
  	
  	The .cdr tracks are in the native CD audio format. They can
  	be either written on a CD-R using cdrecord -audio, or converted
  	to WAV (or any other sound format for that matter) using
  	sox.

  How to install this stuff:
  	
  	gzip -d -c bchunk-1.0.0.tar.gz | tar xvf -
  	cd bchunk-1.0.0
  	make
  	
  	... and copy the resulting 'bchunk' binary to your favourite
  	directory in your $PATH. /usr/local/bin is a good one.
  	
  	If your system does not have GCC installed, edit Makefile,
  	uncommenting the CC lines.
  	
  	bchunk has been successfully compiled on the following platforms:
  	
  		Linux 2.0, i686, glibc 2.0.7, gcc 2.7.2.3  (RedHat 5.1)
  		Solaris 2.5.1, SPARC, gcc 2.7.2
  		Solaris 2.6, SPARC, gcc 2.8.1
  		Digital Unix 4.0c, Alpha, DEC C V5.2-033
  	
  	It should be ANSI enough to compile on any decent system.
  	(The HP-UX bundled compiler is not decent.)

  How to use this stuff:
  
  	bchunk [-v] <image.bin> <image.cue> <basename>
  	
  	image.bin is the raw cd image file. image.cue is the
  	track index file containing track types and offsets.
  	basename is used for the beginning part of the created
  	track files.
	
	The [-v] flag makes binchunker print some more unnecessary
	messages, which should not be of interest for anyone.
